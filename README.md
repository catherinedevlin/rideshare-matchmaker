# rideshare-matchmaker
Service to find and notify potential carpool partners among travelers to a given place

Event organizers should submit their attendees' contact info
and zip/postal codes to the service, along with the zip/postal
code of the event.  rideshare-matchmaker will determine which
attendees live close to each other (relative to the destination)
and contact them, suggesting that they arrange to share rides.

Should also be useful for employers to suggest carpools to their
employees.

Using the project's issue tracker to think through and 
discuss technical and legal obstacles.

For pity's sake, PLEASE steal this idea and implement it.
The environment needs it.
